        <h2>Week 2 - Grasping HTML, CSS, and Basic SQL</h2>
        <p>During the second week of my course, I embarked on a journey into the world of web development and databases. Here's what I learned:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>HTML Fundamentals: I delved into HTML and mastered the art of creating the structure of web pages. I learned about elements, tags, and how to build the foundation of a web page.</li>
            <li>CSS Basics: I explored CSS and gained the ability to style and format web pages. This included understanding selectors, properties, and how to make web content visually appealing.</li>
            <li>Basic SQL Knowledge: I dipped my toes into the world of databases and SQL. I acquired an understanding of SQL syntax, how to query databases, and retrieve data.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Discoveries</h2>
        <p>As I delved into HTML, CSS, and SQL, I made some intriguing discoveries:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Responsive Web Design: I realized the importance of creating responsive web pages that adapt to different screen sizes. This involved using CSS techniques like media queries.</li>
            <li>CSS Frameworks: I discovered the existence of CSS frameworks like Bootstrap, which can expedite the process of building attractive web interfaces.</li>
            <li>Structured Data: I learned how to use HTML to structure web content semantically, making it more accessible and understandable to search engines.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Challenges Faced</h2>
        <p>While the journey through HTML, CSS, and SQL was exciting, I encountered a few challenges along the way:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>CSS Attributes: Re-understanding CSS specificity and attributes was a bit tricky, as I hadn't used it since a college assignemnt one year ago. But practice and experimentation helped me overcome this hurdle.</li>
            <li>SQL Syntax: SQL syntax can be quite precise, and I had to be cautious about syntax errors in my queries. Patience and practice were my allies here.</li>
            <li>Group Project on CSS Properties: My first instance with working with another student went very well. We discussed potential things to cover, set in stone who would discuss what, and created template websites to showcase the designated height and width property. This set us apart from the other presentations in my opinion.</li>
        </ul>

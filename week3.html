        <h2>Week 3 - SDLC, Agile, and Website Development</h2>
        <p>In the third week of my course, I ventured into the world of Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), explored Agile methodologies, and took the next step in developing my website journal. Here's what I learned:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>SDLC Fundamentals: I gained a deep understanding of the SDLC, its phases, and how it forms the backbone of software development projects.</li>
            <li>Agile Approaches: I discovered the various approaches to Agile, emphasizing flexibility, collaboration, and iterative development.</li>
            <li>Website Journal Development: I continued to develop my website journal, a project set last week detailing my experiences on this course. I enhanced its structure and viewability.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Theory Discoveries</h2>
        <p>During my exploration of the SDLC, I made some fascinating discoveries:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The Adaptability of the SDLC - I learned that the SDLC can be adapted to suit different project needs, and it's not a one-size-fits-all approach.</li>
            <li>The Values of Agile: I discovered the importance of Agile values like individuals and interactions, working solutions, and customer collaboration in delivering successful projects.</li>
            <li>Agile's Iterative Development: Agile's iterative approach allows for continuous improvement and the ability to adapt to changing requirements.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>My Website Journal - Code Refinements and Solutions</h2>
        <p>As I continued to develop my website journal, I encountered several opportunities for code refinements and solutions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>CSS Flexbox Enhancements: I improved the navigation bar using CSS Flexbox, making it even more flexible and responsive to different screen sizes.</li>
            <li>Accessibility Improvements: I incorporated accessible design principles, ensuring that my website is usable by a wide range of users, including those with disabilities.</li>
            <li>Performance Optimization: I optimized the website's performance by reducing load times and ensuring efficient resource loading.</li>
        </ul>

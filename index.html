        <h2>About the Bootcamp</h2>
        <p>The course I'm currently attending is a Bootcamp centered around software development, where learners like me gain valuable insights on software development principles, techniques and proficiency in JavaScript. Additionally, soft skills as well as technical skills are developed as a result of attending this bootcamp, which seperates this course from many other, making it an intestive and immersive experience!
            In the next pages, i'll be discussing the content learned during my weeks attending this course, how I felt about it and go in depth on its importance in web development.

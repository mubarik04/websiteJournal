        <h2>Week 1 - Learning JavaScript Fundamentals</h2>
        <p>In the first week of my course, I delved into the fascinating world of JavaScript. I acquired a solid understanding of the fundamentals, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Variables and data types - I learned about let and const variables, and how to store different types of data such as numbers, strings, and booleans.</li>
            <li>Conditional statements - I explored if and else statements, and how to control the flow of my code based on conditions.</li>
            <li>Loops - I discovered the concept of loops, which allowed me to repeat tasks efficiently with for and while loops.</li>
            <li>Functions - I grasped the concept of functions and arrays.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Challenges and discoveries</h2>
        <p>During my exploration of the JavaScript fundamentals, I faced many challenges (who's suprised) as well as interesting discoveries:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Understanding loops: I failed to grasp the concept of loops when first introduced to me. After practicing via online learning platforms and youtube tutorials, I was able to understand how to effectively use them</li>
            <li>Operators: I was constantly getting confused with some arithmetic operators, such as modulus, and practiced enough to comprehend the terminology thrown at me and when it should be used.</li>
            <li>Friday's Technical Assessment: I came across ways to debug my code more effectively, due to the mistakes initially inputted in.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Employability Session</h2>
        <p>My first Employability Session of the course consisted of setting in stone achievable goals through out the duration of this course, how i'll achieve these and refelcted upon next steps after completing this course. Filled out a form that would be used for future one to one sessions.</p>
